# First, Thank's for deciding to contribute to the project!

No, seriously. Thank's for taking your time and reporting a issue/fixing something.
Just pointing something out that's obvious might help!

# But, wait.

Take note of these:
  - Please make sure someone didn't already point that thing out. Scour the issues/pull requests page.
  - Even if it's a serious bug or just a tiny suggestion, please label it in the title.
